## Introduction

Here we present a technical documentation for the implementation of LACPASS, detailing how the solution operates and the necessary steps that participating countries must take to join LACPASS.

The Latin American and Caribbean Vaccination Pass, LACPASS, is an application for the exchange of information on vaccination status of Latin American and Caribbean countries, which allows people who have received part or all of the COVID vaccination scheme in their country of residence, when traveling to another country in the region, they can simply and verifiably validate their vaccination status in the country of destination, without the need to carry out additional procedures such as homologation of the local vaccination certificate.

The LACPASS project is an initiative of the American Network for Cooperation in Electronic Health in Latin America and the Caribbean (RACSEL), sponsored by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and executed by the National Center for Information Systems of Chile (CENS) by through the private company Create de Chile, which was awarded the tender for the development and implementation of this public good.

The technology behind LACPASS is based on the Digital Green Certificates of the European Union (EU-DGC), this repository is an open source project used in all the countries of the European Union and 24 countries outside it. This pass is multilanguage and is available in English, Spanish, French and Portuguese which are of special interest in this region. In addition, it can be digital and on paper, and has a verifiable QR code through the applications provided by the DGC. By connecting interested countries to LACPASS it is possible to use the same technology to connect to the Digital Green Certificates of the European Union.

The main objective of the LACPASS project is to connect in a secure and verifiable way the information on individual vaccination of the residents of the countries of the region in a uniform and interoperable system that facilitates travel within the region by delivering to the health and immigration authorities of the countries a tool that provides accurate and timely information on the vaccination status of passengers who are entering or passing through.

As an additional objective, it seeks to collaborate with the countries of the region so that they can connect in a simple and fluid way to the Digital Green Certificates technology of the European Union.
